    <em>- Small Tips for writing a Thesis -</em>

    <p>
        The introductory paragraph of any paper, long or short, should <b>start with a sentence that piques 
        the interest of your readers.</b> 
        In a typical essay, that first sentence leads into two or three more sentences that provide 
        details about your subject or your process. 
        <i>All of these sentences build up to your thesis statement.</i>
        <br />
        <strong>Bad</strong> example to start a Thesis:
        -<q>Our body makes up around 70% of <abbr title="Formula for Water">H<sub>2</sub>O</abbr>. Needless to say, water has a lot of benefits for our body.</q>
        <br />
        <strong>Good</strong> example to start a Thesis:
        -<q>Water is one of the most important elements on Earth and also, for our body.</q>

        I first studied the effect of plants on humans for my Yale thesis... 
        and it was a 185-page thesis, and luckily I got honors on it.

    <p>
        <cite><strong>Thesis</strong> statements are not merely opinion statements.</cite>
        <br />

        But in this format, it doesn't offer the reader much information;
         it sounds like the author is simply stating a viewpoint that may or may not be substantiated by <dfn>evidence</dfn>.
